# that distance to Kilometer and present the kilometers.
# The conversion formula is as follows: Miles=Kilometers√ó0.6214


# In[2]:


def  Miles_Converter():   # by using the miles converter function it will display the distance in kilometer for the usuer input distance in miles
    
    miles = float(input("ENTER THE VALUE FOR THE DISTANCE IN MILES : "))
    km = miles / 0.6214
    print ("THE DISTANCE IN KILOMETER IS: ", km)
